## üîß Installation steps

Please carefully follow these installation steps. They have been updated for plugin version `5.0.0`.

### [iOS Setup](https://github.com/gdelataillade/alarm/blob/main/help/INSTALL-IOS.md)
### [Android Setup](https://github.com/gdelataillade/alarm/blob/main/help/INSTALL-ANDROID.md)

## üìñ How to use

Add to your pubspec.yaml:
```Bash
flutter pub add alarm
```

First, you have to initialize the Alarm service in your `main` function:
```Dart
WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
await Alarm.init()
```

Then, you have to define your alarm settings:
```Dart
final alarmSettings = AlarmSettings(
  id: 42,
  dateTime: dateTime,
  assetAudioPath: 'assets/alarm.mp3',
  loopAudio: true,
  vibrate: true,
  warningNotificationOnKill: Platform.isIOS,
  androidFullScreenIntent: true,
  volumeSettings: VolumeSettings.fade(
    volume: 0.8,
    fadeDuration: Duration(seconds: 5),
    volumeEnforced: true,
  ),
  notificationSettings: const NotificationSettings(
    title: 'This is the title',
    body: 'This is the body',
    stopButton: 'Stop the alarm',
    icon: 'notification_icon',
    iconColor: Color(0xff862778),
  ),
);
```

And finally set the alarm:
```Dart
await Alarm.set(alarmSettings: alarmSettings)
```

### AlarmSettings model
Property |   Type     | Description
-------- |------------| ---------------
id |   `int`     | Unique identifier of the alarm.
dateTime |   `DateTime`     | The date and time you want your alarm to ring.
assetAudioPath |   `String`     | The path to you audio asset you want to use as ringtone. Can be a path in your assets folder or a local file path with Android permission.
loopAudio |   `bool`     | If true, audio will repeat indefinitely until alarm is stopped.
vibrate |   `bool`     | If true, device will vibrate indefinitely until alarm is stopped. If [loopAudio] is set to false, vibrations will stop when audio ends.
warningNotificationOnKill |   `bool`     | Whether to show a notification when application is killed to warn the user that the alarm he set may not ring. Recommanded for iOS. Enabled by default.
androidFullScreenIntent |   `bool`     | Whether to turn screen on when android alarm notification is triggered. Enabled by default.
allowAlarmOverlap | `bool` | Whether the alarm should ring if another alarm is already ringing. Disabled by default.
androidStopAlarmOnTermination | `bool` | Whether to stop the alarm when an Android task is terminated. Enabled by default.
payload | `String?` | Optional data sent with the alarm. Caller handles serialization and parsing.
[notificationSettings](#notificationsettings-model) | `NotificationSettings` | Settings for notification title, body, icon, icon color and action buttons (only stop at the moment).
[volumeSettings](#volumesettings-model) | `VolumeSettings` | Settings for alarm volume and fade durations.


If you enabled `warningNotificationOnKill`, you can choose your own notification title and body by using this method before setting your alarms:
```Dart
await Alarm.setWarningNotificationOnKill(title, body)
```

The property `androidStopAlarmOnTermination` works only on Android as on iOS the alarm is naturally stopped by the system when the app is terminated (as the native code can no longer run).

### NotificationSettings model

Property |   Type     | Description
-------- |------------| ---------------
title |   `String`     | Title of the alarm notification.
body |   `String`     | Body of the alarm notification.
stopButton | `String?` | Text shown in the stop button of the alarm notification. Button not shown if null.
icon | `String?` | Icon to display on the notification. Only customizable on Android.
iconColor | `Color?` | Color of the notification icon. Only customizable on Android.

### VolumeSettings model

Property |   Type     | Description
-------- |------------| ---------------
volume |   `double?`     | Sets system volume level (0.0 to 1.0). Reverts on alarm stop. Defaults to current volume if null.
fadeDuration | `Duration?` | Duration over which to fade the alarm ringtone. Null means no fade.
fadeSteps | `List<VolumeFadeStep>` | Controls how the alarm volume will fade over time.
volumeEnforced | `bool` | Automatically resets to the original alarm [volume] if the user attempts to adjust it. Disabled by default.

This is how to stop/cancel your alarm:
```Dart
await Alarm.stop(id)
```

This is how to run some code when alarm starts ringing.
```Dart
Alarm.ringing.listen((AlarmSet alarmSet) {
  for (final alarm in alarmSet.alarms) {
    // yourOnRingCallback
  }
});
```
You can also listen to the `Alarm.updateStream` to know when an alarm is added, updated, or stopped.

To avoid unexpected behaviors, if you set an alarm for the same time, down to the second, as an existing one, the new alarm will replace the existing one.

## üì± Example app

## ‚è∞ Alarm behaviour

|                          | Sound | Vibrate | Volume | Notification
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------- | -------| -------
| Locked screen            |  ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ
| Silent / Mute            |  ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ
| Do not disturb           |  ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ     | Silenced
| Sleep mode               |  ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ     | Silenced
| While playing other media|  ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ
| App killed               |  ü§ñ   | ü§ñ       | ü§ñ     | ‚úÖ

‚úÖ : iOS and Android.\
ü§ñ : Android only.\
Silenced: Means that the notification is not shown directly on the top of the screen. You have to go in your notification center to see it.

## üìã Logging

This plugin uses the [logging package](https://pub.dev/packages/logging) to log information. If you aren't already, (optional) you'll need to install and configre the logging package to see these logs.

An example can be found in `example/lib/utils/logging.dart`. This file defines a `setupLogging` method which is called from `main.dart`.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Why didn't my alarm fire on iOS?

Several factors could prevent your alarm from ringing:
- Your iPhone was restarted (either from a manual reboot or due to an iOS update).
- The app was either manually terminated or was closed because of memory constraints.

### My alarm is not firing on a specific Android device

Some Android manufacturers prefer battery life over proper functionality of your apps. Check out [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) to find out about more about optimizations done by different vendors, and potential workarounds.
Most common solution is to educate users to disable **battery optimization** settings.
*Source: [android_alarm_manager_plus FAQ](https://pub.dev/packages/android_alarm_manager_plus#faq)*

### Why can‚Äôt I dismiss my Android alarm notification?

The alarm plugin uses Android‚Äôs Foreground Service to ensure the alarm can trigger even if the app is killed. For Android 12+, notifications from foreground services cannot be dismissed due to new Android rules. This ensures users are always aware of ongoing processes that might affect battery life or device performance.

### How can I increase the reliability of the alarm ringing?

The more time the app spends in the background, the higher the chance the OS might stop it from running due to memory or battery optimizations. Here's how you can optimize:

- **Battery Optimization**: Educate users to disable battery optimization on Android.
- **Regular App Usage**: Encourage users to open the app at least once a day.
- **Leverage Background Modes**: Engage in activities like weather API calls that keep the app active in the background.
- **User Settings**: Educate users to refrain from using 'Do Not Disturb' and 'Low Power Mode' when they're expecting the alarm to ring.

### How can I make my alarm periodic ?

While periodic alarms can be implemented on Android, this is not feasible for iOS. To maintain consistency between both platforms, I will not be adding this feature to the package (except if a solution is found). As an alternative, you could store the scheduled days for alarms and reset them for the upcoming week each time the app is launched.

Related issue [here](https://github.com/gdelataillade/alarm/issues/47#issuecomment-1820896276).

### Why does my app crash on iOS?

Crashes such as `EXC_BAD_ACCESS KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS` occur if `Alarm.set` and `Alarm.stop` methods are called concurrently, as they both modify shared resources. To prevent this, ensure each method call is completed before starting the next by using the `await` keyword in Dart:
```
await Alarm.set
await Alarm.stop
```
This approach ensures safe and exclusive access to shared resources, preventing crashes.


### Why was my app rejected by the **App Store** ?

The rejection may relate to plugin's background audio functionality, essential for alarm apps. Clarify in your submission that background activity is crucial for your alarm app to notify users effectively. Ensure compliance with Apple's guidelines on background processes.

For more guidance, see: [App Store Rejection Issues](https://github.com/gdelataillade/alarm/discussions/87).

### Why was my app rejected by the **Play Store** ?

If your app was rejected by Google due to restrictions on the `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` permission, it is because Google has implemented strict policies regarding the use of this permission to ensure user safety and prevent misuse. What you can do is either remove the declaration of this permission from your app or provide a strong justification and request users to manually grant the permission through the app settings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Under the hood

### How does `alarm` work?

Check out this interactive walkthrough of the `alarm` codebase on CodeCanvas [here](https://www.code-canvas.com/?session=unauthenticatedGithub&repo=alarm&owner=gdelataillade&branch=main).

<img width="1916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f85c1c0-5348-4eed-bfa8-de8852925826" />


### Android
Leverages a foreground service with AlarmManager scheduling to ensure alarm reliability, even if the app is terminated. Utilizes AudioManager for robust alarm sound management.

### iOS
Keeps the app awake using a silent `AVAudioPlayer` until alarm rings. When in the background, it also uses `Background App Refresh` to periodically ensure the app is still active.
